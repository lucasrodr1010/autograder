# COP2273 Autograder - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **File Mode and Folder Mode Support**

- Added radio buttons to switch between "Folder Mode" and "File Mode"
- Folder Mode: For assignments with multiple student folders (e.g., PCA6)
- File Mode: For assignments with single Python files
- Dynamic file browser that changes based on selected mode

### 2. **Utility Import Support**

- Added "Utility Path" field for importing helper modules like graphics.py
- Automatically adds utility path to PYTHONPATH environment variable
- Allows student submissions to import utility modules seamlessly

### 3. **Test Cases Scrollbar**

- Implemented scrollable test cases area using Canvas and Scrollbar
- Users can now add many test cases and scroll through them
- Fixed the issue where test cases were not visible

### 4. **Removed PCA6/LR Defaults**

- Made the autograder completely generic
- Removed all hardcoded references to PCA6, LR, or specific assignments
- Title now shows "COP2273 Autograder" instead of "COP2273 Autograder - PCA6"
- All labels and placeholders are now generic

### 5. **Improved Test Case Interface**

- Replaced default test case with placeholder text: "Enter test input here..."
- Placeholder text disappears when user starts typing
- Gray placeholder text that becomes black when user enters content
- Better validation to ensure test cases are actually filled

### 6. **Fixed Execution Issues**

- Fixed path handling in script execution
- Scripts now run correctly from their respective directories
- Proper working directory management for module imports
- Fixed the issue where autograder wasn't running submissions

## 🚀 New Features

### **Dual Mode Support**

```
Folder Mode: PCA6/
├── LR/ (base solution)
├── AF/ (student submission)
├── AL/ (student submission)
└── ...

File Mode: Assignment/
├── solution.py (base solution)
├── student1.py (student submission)
├── student2.py (student submission)
└── graphics.py (utility)
```

### **Utility Module Support**

- Set utility path to include folders with helper modules
- Automatic PYTHONPATH configuration
- Supports any utility modules (graphics.py, math_utils.py, etc.)

### **Enhanced GUI**

- Scrollable test cases area
- Placeholder text for better UX
- Generic labels and titles
- Better error handling and validation

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### For PCA6:

1. Run `python autograder.py` or double-click `run_autograder.bat`
2. Select "Folder Mode"
3. Set Base Solution: `PCA6/LR/`
4. Set Assignment Path: `PCA6/`
5. Add test case: `1, 1` (first line), `5` (second line)
6. Click "Run Autograder"

### For Other Assignments:

1. Choose appropriate mode (File or Folder)
2. Set base solution path
3. Set assignment path
4. Set utility path if needed
5. Add test cases
6. Run autograder

## 🧪 Testing

The autograder has been tested with:

- ✅ PCA6 Fibonacci sequence assignment
- ✅ Multiple student submissions (LR, AF, AL, etc.)
- ✅ Both file and folder modes
- ✅ Utility module imports
- ✅ Various test case formats

```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Generic Design**: Works with any assignment, not just PCA6
2. **Robust Execution**: Handles path issues and module imports correctly
3. **Better UX**: Scrollable interface, placeholder text, clear feedback
4. **Flexible Input**: Supports both single files and folder structures
5. **Utility Support**: Easy integration of helper modules
6. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and validation

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **GUI Framework**: tkinter with ttk widgets
- **Threading**: Background execution to prevent GUI freezing
- **Path Handling**: Proper working directory management
- **Environment**: PYTHONPATH configuration for utility modules
- **Timeout**: 30-second timeout per test case
- **Comparison**: Normalized output comparison for formatting differences

The autograder is now production-ready and can handle a wide variety of assignments beyond PCA6!
